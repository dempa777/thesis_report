\section{Problem formulation}
This section covers the problem formulations which were set up at the beginning of this thesis. The problem formulation has functioned as guidelines throughout the work of the thesis.
\begin{itemize}
  \item How can distance fields be used when rendering text and how does the technique work?
  \item What distance field size is it necessary to use for the rendered text to get equally good appearance as the text rendered from Visiarcs current text rendering implementation?
  \item Is it possible to generate distance field in real time fast enough that the user can not tell the difference if it was pre generated or not?
\end{itemize}
