abstract = "We present a modified distance measure for use with distance transforms of anti-aliased, area sampled grayscale images of arbitrary binary contours. The modified measure can be used in any vector-propagation Euclidean distance transform. Our test implementation in the traditional \{SSED8\} algorithm shows a considerable improvement in accuracy and homogeneity of the distance field compared to a traditional binary image transform. At the expense of a 10× slowdown for a particular image resolution, we achieve an accuracy comparable to a binary transform on a supersampled image with 16&#xa0;×&#xa0;16 higher resolution, which would require 256 times more computations and memory.

  abstract = "Based on a two-component descriptor, a distance label for each point, it is shown that Euclidean distance maps can be generated by effective sequential algorithms. The map indicates, for each pixel in the objects (or the background) of the originally binary picture, the shortest distance to the nearest pixel in the background (or the objects). A map with negligible errors can be produced in two picture scans which has to include forward and backward movement for each line. Thus, for expanding/shrinking purposes it may compete very successfully with iterative parallel propagation in the binary picture itself. It is shown that skeletons can be produced by simple procedures and since these are based on Euclidean distances it is assumed that they are superior to skeletons based on d4−, d8−, and even octagonal metrics.

abstract={A distance field is a representation where, at each point within the field, we know the distance from that point to the closest point on any object within the domain. In addition to distance, other properties may be derived from the distance field, such as the direction to the surface, and when the distance field is signed, we may also determine if the point is internal or external to objects within the domain. The distance field has been found to be a useful construction within the areas of computer vision, physics, and computer graphics. This paper serves as an exposition of methods for the production of distance fields, and a review of alternative representations and applications of distance fields. In the course of this paper, we present various methods from all three of the above areas, and we answer pertinent questions such as How accurate are these methods compared to each other? How simple are they to implement?, and What is the complexity and runtime of such methods?.},
